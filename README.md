## Introduction
This is a simplified LaTex template of BNU thesis without cover, using .bib / bibTex to manage references in GBT 7714 style. 

Many thanks for these two projects : [BNU Bachelor Template](https://github.com/Hggg/BNU-Bachelor-Template) and [GBT7714 bibTex](https://github.com/zepinglee/gbt7714-bibtex-style), which are important basis of this project.

## Features
This Template cites references in GBT 7714 style using bibTex.

It can take subgraphs and has solved the related compatibility issues.

Fontsize is more accurate.

## Use
The examples of reference citation and subgraph use are included in this template.

For reference citation, write the references in bibTex style in file Example.bib. Two simple ways to get the bibTex formation: Baidu Xueshu and Google Scholar - serch the article name in one of these two websites -> click 'Cite' -> click 'bibTex'. 

MUST use pdflatex -> bibtex -> pdflatex -> pdflatex.

## Issues
NO known issues in this template.

However this template does not have cover. Reasons are complicated. And this might be improved in the future.
